## ChromaSC - Gene set analysis along single cell RNA-seq pseudotime trajectories

ChromaSC uses a sliding-window method to estimate gene set enrichment along a non-branching pseudotime trajectory inferred from single cell RNA-seq data. ChromaSC can be used to identify changes in gene set regulation across a trajectory or to compare enrichment between populations at points along the trajectory.
