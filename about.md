## Current Research

I am a 2nd year PhD student working in [Dr. Jill Mesirov's lab](http://mesirovlab.org) at UC San Diego. My research involves using computational approaches to identify and understand the pathways and processes that define cellular states in cancer with the goal of discovering novel therapeutic targets and matching patients to treatments. Additionally, I contribute to notebook and module development in the [GenePattern](http://genepattern.org) environment to empower non-programmers to execute and document reproducible *in silico* research without reading or writing code.

## Education & Experience

I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Northwestern University in 2017. My research career started in the lab of [Dr. Aleksandar Kuzmanovic](http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/website/index-a.html) where I worked on problems in computer networking protocols. I contributed to several projects including "[KickAss](http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/publications/kickass/icnp2016-flores.pdf)", a backwards-compatible congestion management system for TCP (ICNP 2016), "Oak", a system to identify and replace slow-loading webpage elements for individual users (ICDCS 2017), and "[Fury Route](http://networks.cs.northwestern.edu/publications/fury_route/fury_route.pdf)", which leveraged content delivery networks to remotely estimate network distance (PAM 2018). 

I discovered my interest in Bioinformatics in the lab of [Dr. Jaehyuk Choi](http://choilaboratory.org) at Northwestern's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center. I built a computational pipeline to identify genetic mutations in large whole genome sequencing cohorts for multiple lymphoma subtypes including [DLBCL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29857068) and a [cohort of 220 CTCL patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28694326) with which our group identified a novel putative oncogenic mutation in the *RLTPR* gene.
